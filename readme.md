CIS++: Modelling tools for Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) of plasmas.


This project is a port of the Python library PyCIS to C++. I'm aiming to match functionality by end of Sept 2022. It is currently an untested work-in-progress.


Requires:
- [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen): Linear algebra library used for Mueller matrix model.
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp): .YAML config file parsing.
- [FFTW](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3): Fast Fourier transforms used in demodulation of data (not implemented yet).
